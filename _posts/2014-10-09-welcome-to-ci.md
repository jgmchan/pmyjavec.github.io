Welcome to my new blog, been quite sometime since I've had one. I'm Looking forward to sharing interesting information, ideas and more using this blog. All in the name of continuous improvement!

I've chosen to use [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) for this blog and I have to say it's brilliant, super fun to use, hackable and easy to get started.
