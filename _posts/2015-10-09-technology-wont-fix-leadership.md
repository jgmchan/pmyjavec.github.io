Introduction
------------

I'm writing this coming to the end of a 3 year stint working as a computer systems engineer at my first [megacorp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megacorporation). I've decided I absolutely must blog about some of the things I will take away from it.

It's been a super interesting experience and I'm grateful for each day I spent working there. I doubt a day went by I
didn't learn something whether it be positive or negative.

Starting Out
------------

My first 3 months was full of excitement, naivety, enthusiasm and confusion. I started in a rather large team which
seemed to have endless scope and what felt like zero focus. There was just so many problems to solve and being someone
who enjoys problem solving the opportunities to help out felt endless. It was hard to know where to begin. I thought I
hit the jackpot.

After some analysis my cognitive bias had the problem spaces in the following order, technological, process, personal,
political and team dynamics.

I could see everything as fixable using automation, technology and ticket tracking, endless ticket tracking.

My enthusiasm was boundless, I wanted to learn all I could and be hands on. I made friends with engineers who felt
similar and on we went. But I couldn't quite see the elephant in the room even though I could sense it.

Making Improvements
------------------

Time went by and so many issues remained, but I was dedicated. I was working long hours, weekends, attending conferences, meet-ups and doing my best to learn more, become better at my job, automate systems etc.

As this was a large corporation getting things into production was difficult, very difficult. Multiple teams were
involved, getting something into production was honestly brutal, we did make inroads and improvements but if I'm honest
it's still about the same.

Testing, software , operations, change management, security and a _special_ IT operations team had to be in involved in
deploying a new system, and most of them for changing one line in a file.

My team managed to improved things, we really did. But it did take it's toll on people. I saw burn outs,
friendships disintegrate, passionate arguments end in verbal abuse, teams split up and great people leave. We went
through a pretty unhappy place to get there but we laid down the foundations for better times.j

I was moved to a smaller team with just one other friend and again we managed to make serious inroads. This team was expanding, learning, shipping code to production frequently and seriously good fun.

But it was still a massive challenge, Why?

The Elephant in the Room
------------------------

By this point I had matured technically, learned incredible amounts and my good friend who I started the team with had enough
of megacorps(tm) and left.

Around the same time however we had an organisation "shake up" and new _leaders_. These are the kind of leaders you
never get to meet or see because they're "too high up the chain.", in the heavens?

We were forced to take on what are known as "offshore resources" (I like to call them people) and all sorts of other
silly things, even though I would strongly advise against it. The blame games, silly ideas were coming on stronger, harder and faster
than I could oppose them. Then I had a moment of clarity. All of a sudden it hit me.

I realised that no amount of technology or engineering could fix the problems we were increasingly facing.

The elephant in the room, the big issue was one of leadership issues.

Conclusion
----------

As engineer I believe we need to be mindful that we're in positions which allow us to truly focus on engineering
solutions and not constantly working around poor or missing leadership. Why? Because it's seriously unhealthy and can
crush your enthusiasm from that which you once loved.

As engineers we need to make sure that we're not digging bigger holes for ourselves by using technology, agile or devops to feel a
leadership void. If you do it will only result in more baggage loss of personal time and potential serious burnout.

While it might sound obvious, Unfortunately I see people making the same mistakes constantly.

I'm not deluded about the fact that as an engineer part of the job is consultation and fighting for you you believe in  but if you're constantly pushing shit up hill, feeling pressure from "above" and not being heard, try a little harder if there is no improvement, it might be time to move on.

Peace!
